# Verifiable Document: Proof of Authenticity and Provenance

## Introduction

### Definition
- aka a non-transferable document
- not used to transfer title
- the ownership to goods
- a document for which its authenticity and source can be verified

### Examples
- Sales invoices
- Certificates
- Permits

## Implementation

For Verifiable Documents , we will implement Document Store Smart Contract in TradeTrust by stateless smart contract in Algorand. It aims to provide the proof of provenance and non-temper for trade documents. The subroutines include:
1. Create Document - `createDocument()`
2. Verify Document - `verifyDocument()`
3. Revoke Document - `revokeDocument()`

Other than these subroutines, we may implement the following helper functions:
- `wrapDocument()`: <input> string; <output> hash
- `compareHash`: compare hash
- `issueDocument()`: issue asset

### Create Document
- Function Name: `createDocument()`
- [Algorand - Creating an Asset](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/features/asa/#creating-an-asset)
- Description:
  - take as input a html file as string of arbitrary length
  - hash the string (wrap the document) by `wrapDocument()`
  - configure the asset
  - issue document by `issueDocument()`

### Verify Document
- Function Name: `verifyDocument()`
- Features
  - verify the provenance of a document
  - verify that the document has not been tampered
- Possible Algorand Feature: Logic Signature
- Description:
  - take as input a document id and a html file as string of arbitrary length
  - hash the string (wrap the document) by `wrapDocument()`
  - compare hash of the documents by `compareHash`

### Revoke Document
- Function Name: `revokeDocument()`
- [TradeTrust - Revoking Documents](https://www.openattestation.com/docs/verifiable-document/revoking-document)
- [Algorand - Destroying an Asset](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/features/asa/#destroying-an-asset)

## Appendix
The Prototype V1 is able to provide proof of authenticityandprovenanceoftradedocumentation by leveraging on the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT). Current forms of digital documentation are neither tamper-proof nor able to prove the source of origin resulting in trade transactions still falling back to paper documentation at some point in the supply chain. V1â€™s capability addresses these gaps by providing tamper-proof features, enabling documentation tracing to the source of origin. Through the use of V1 features, participants of TradeTrust are able to verify the authenticity and provenance of a digital document.
